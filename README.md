## 🤖 Prompts Used and Refinements Made

### AI Question Generation Prompt:
```
Generate [number] MCQs on "[topic]".
Each question must have only [number] options.
Language: [language], Difficulty: [difficulty], Grade: [grade].
```

The AI prompt was refined multiple times to ensure:
- Questions were diverse and challenging
- The difficulty level was appropriate
- Options were plausible but with only one correct answer
- Questions were free of cultural or regional bias
- Output was consistently formatted as valid JSON

### AI Feedback Prompt:
```
User score: [score]/100
Quiz summary: [summary of questions and answers]

Provide:
- 3 strengths based on what the user did well in the quiz
- 3 areas for improvement
- 3 specific mistakes identified and why they happened
- A brief conclusion paragraph
- An encouraging message
```

Prompt refinements focused on:
- Making feedback constructive and encouraging
- Ensuring analysis was relevant to the quiz content
- Providing actionable improvement suggestions
- Maintaining consistent tone and formatting

```

### Component Flow

1. **User selects a topic** (TopicSelection.jsx)
2. **User configures quiz settings** (SettingSelection.jsx)
3. **Backend generates questions** via AI services
4. **User answers questions** (QuestionCard.jsx)
5. **User submits answers** (SubmitPopUp.jsx)
6. **Backend generates feedback** based on answers
7. **User views results and analysis** (Result.jsx)

### API Integration

- Frontend uses Axios to communicate with the backend
- Backend communicates with AI services (OpenAI and Google Gemini)
- Environment variables manage API endpoints and keys

## 🧠 State Management Choices

The application uses **React Context API** for state management through `QuizContext.jsx`. This choice was made for several reasons:

- **Appropriate complexity** - The application's state needs are well-served by Context without introducing the overhead of Redux
- **Component sharing** - Multiple components need access to quiz state (topic, questions, answers, etc.)
- **Simplified prop drilling** - Avoids passing props through intermediate components
- **Centralized logic** - State transitions and quiz logic are kept in one place
- **Easy access** - Any component can access or update state through the useQuiz hook

The Context implementation uses a reducer pattern similar to Redux, making state updates predictable and maintainable.
